# plot 1 allows you to detect the shape of residuals e.g. constant variance, patterns
# should be randomly displaced around 0 and evenly spread throughout

# plot 2 checks whether residuals follow a standard normal distribution
# if they fall along diagonal then fitness is good

# plot 3 isnt too important for this course

# plot 4 shows standardised residuals and leverage
# any residuals which are above 3 or below -3 are most likely outliers.
# for every 100 data points there should be only 1 that is below/above -3/3
# leverage shows how influential each data point is on the model i.e. the drag of each point

#Since home prices tend to vary more as they get larger, the amount of rent charged is likely to
